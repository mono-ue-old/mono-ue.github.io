<h1>Tech Features</h1>

	<p class="lead">Some of the exciting features provided by <em>Mono for
	Unreal Engine.</em></p>

<h2>Hot Reload</h2>

	<p>We fully support Unreal Engine's <em>Hot Reload</em>
	functionality.

	<p>This means that whenever you rebuild your C# code in
	Xamarin Studio, your changes are immediately reloated into the
	Unreal Editor.    The changes are also reflected with running
	games in the editor, so you can quickly iterate on your
	design. 

	<p>On fast machines, the process of rebuilding the C# code and
	reloading it live takes less than a second.  It feel
	instantaneous.
	
<h2>Xamarin Studio</h2>

	<p>While hard core hackers are happy editing their game code
	with <code>vi</code> or <code>emacs</code> and have the hot
	reload functionality do all the work for them, we have also
	provided a nice integration with
	the <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com">MonoDevelop</a> (and 
	Xamarin's branded
	version, <a href="http://xamarin.com/studio"> Xamarin
	Studio</a>). 

	<p>It provides a first-class IDE with rich, accurate code
	completion, and powerful refactoring and analysis tools.

<h2>Debugging</h2>

	<p>Full support for C# debugging is included. Simply launch
	your game from Xamarin Studio as a standalone editor or mobile
	preview process, and it will connect to the runtime debug
	engine, giving you full access to a rich suite of abilities
	to inspect and debug your code.

<h2>Seamless Blueprint and Editor Integration</h2>

	<p>Your C# classes that are exposed to Unreal Engine are fully
	accessible from Blueprint and the Unreal Editor, just like
	Blueprint-accessible C++ classes.

	<P>You can continue using Blueprint for simple logic and use
	C# when things get more complicated.

	<p>And you can consume your C# classes from Blueprint.
	
<h2>Mixed C#/C++/Blueprint Solutions</h2>

	<p>The same tool that we use to generate bindings to
	Blueprint-exposed Unreal Engine APIs is integrated into Unreal
	Build Tool, and will automatically generate bindings to all of
	your Blueprint-exposed C++ gameplay code and engine
	modifications.
	
<h2>Native Access</h2>

	<p>In addition to the automatically generated bindings to
	Blueprint-exposed Unreal C++ code, the Mono runtime allows
	accessing any native APIs, including custom C/C++ code and the
	native platform API.

	<p>You can manually bind C APIs using
	<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Interop_with_Native_Libraries">Platform
	Invoke</A> services, or use <a href="https://github.com/mono/CppSharp">CppSharp</a>
	to generate bindings to C++ APIs.
		
	<h2>Async Programming</h2>
	
	<p>The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a>
	tutorial shows the low-level approach to defining
	behaviors, but this approach can become cumbersome when
	defining more complex behaviors and AI.  Luckily, this task
	can be simplified with async programming, a C# compiler feature
	that rewrites what appears to be linear code into a state machine.

	<p>For more details about how this helps writing complex
	gameplay logic, see our overview of
	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/async-programming.html">async programming</a>.

<h2>API Profile</h2>

	<p>The <em>Mono Mobile Profile</em> is the core API profile in
	the support for Unreal Engine.

	<p>The Mono Mobile Profile removes a number of bloated .NET
	features including <code>System.Configuration </code> support
	from the Base Class Libraries. This is the same API profile
	used by Xamarin's Android, iOS and Mac products.

	<div class="note"><p>Note: The Mobile Profile is <em>not</em> ABI
	compatible with existing assemblies compiled for a different
	profile (like the .NET desktop, Silverlight or Windows
	Phone). You <em>must</em> recompile your source code to
	generate assemblies targeting the Mobile profile.</p></div>

	<p>A full list of the assemblies in our Mobile framework profile
	can be found <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/framework-profile.html">here</a>.
	
<h2>Portable Class Libraries</h2>

	<p>You can use Portable Class Libraries with Xamarin's Unreal
	Engine support. This allows the same binary library to be
	shared across a wide range of platforms without code modifications.</p>
