<h1>Interop</h1>

    <h4>Is the entire Unreal Engine API surfaced?</h4>

	<p>We currently only surface the Blueprint API, and some
	select APIs that are commonly used in games.

	<p>We are adding more APIs to the binding as we learn what
	developers are using.  

    <h4>Can access existing Blueprints from C#?</h4>

	<p>Yes, you can.   The build process will automatically
	generate the bindings for your blueprints and you can consume
	those as .NET objects.

    <h4>I have some C++ code that I want to surface to C#, how do I do
    this?</h4>

    	<p>Use
    	Mono's <a href="https://github.com/mono/CppSharp">CppSharp</a>
    	project to access native C++ APIs.

<h1>Platform Support</h1

    <h4>What platforms are supported?</h4>

	<p>The initial preview supports Mac and Windows as development
	and deployment targets.   We have internal proof of concept
	setups for Android and iOS.

    <h4>Can I port this to XXX?</h4>

    	<p>The code should be as portable as the intersection of
    	Unreal Engine supported platforms and Mono supported
    	platforms.

	<p>You might need to do some work on your own to support
	platforms that we do not support out of the box, but all of
	the source required to build is available.

    
<h1>Sample Code</h1>

	<h4>Do you have some sample games I can look at?</h4>

	<p>Come back next week, we will be publishing the ShooterGame
	sample, entirely rewritten in C#.
