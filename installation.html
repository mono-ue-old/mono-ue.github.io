<h1>Installing Mono for Unreal Engine</h1>
<p class="lead">Building Unreal Engine with the Mono plugins.</p>

	<p>To install <em>Mono for Unreal Engine</em>, you'll need to
	build the Unreal Editor from source and then add the Mono
	extension that enables the use of C# with Unreal Engine.

	<p>The current add-in has been tested with version 4.4.   This
	page describes how to setup Unreal Engine to allow C#
	development with Mono, and how to setup your MonoDevelop or
	XamarinStudio IDEs to write your C# code.
	
<h2>Building Unreal Engine from Source</h2>



	<ol>
		<li>First, clone the Unreal Engine repo using Git. It
		can be
		found <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine">here</a>.</li>
		
		<li>Check out the 4.4 branch. You can do this by
		running: <pre><code>git checkout 4.4</code></pre> You
		can also use one of the git desktop applications if
		you prefer.</li>
		
		<li>Download the required 4.4 dependencies. There are
		two zip
		files: <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases/download/4.4.3-release/Required_1of2.zip">here</a>
		and <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases/download/4.4.3-release/Required_2of2.zip">here</a></li>
		
		<li>Unzip these dependencies into the directory you
		cloned the UrealEngine repo to. Be careful to make
		sure the folders are merged together, not overwritten
		(on Mac, this can be done by Option->dragging the
		folder into the UnrealEngine directory, and clicking
		"Keep Newer" when prompted).</li>
	</ol>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<ol>
	<li>To build the source on Windows, you need Visual Studio
	2013 installed. You can use the free version if you do not own
	it, <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#DownloadFamilies_2">Visual
	Studio Community 2013</a>.</li>
	
	<li>Install the June 2010 DirectX runtime. This can be
	found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109">here</a>.</li>
	
	<li>In the UnrealEngine folder (the directory you cloned the
	repo into), run <code>GenerateProjectFiles.bat</code>. This
	should run quickly.</li>
	
	<li>Now you can open the Visual Studio Solution that you just
	generated (it should be called <code>UE4.sln</code>).</li>
	
	<li>Once Visual Studio has opened, set the solution
	configuration to Development Editor, and set the platform to
	Win64. Build the project by selecting Build from the
	dropdown menu. This could take a while (up to 40 minutes,
	depending on your system), so go ahead and take a break
	here. Grab a coffee or something.</li>
	
	<li>You can then run the editor from Visual Studio by setting
	the UE4 project as your startup project and pressing the green
	triangle in toolbar (or pressing F5).</li>
	
	<li>Finally, you can setup your Windows shell so that you can
	interact with .uproject files.  Find the file
	called <code>UnrealVersionSelector-Win64-Shippping.exe</code>
	in the <code>UnrealEngine/Engine/Binaries/Win64/_</code>
	folder and run it.  Now, you'll be able to double-click
	.uproject files to load the project, or right click them  
	to quickly update Visual Studio files. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Mac</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>Install Xcode 6.1. You can find this in the app
		store, or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835">here</a>.</li>
		
		<li>From the UnrealEngine folder,
		run <code>GenerateProjectFiles.command</code> (if in
		the finder) or <code>GenerateProjectFiles.sh</code>
		(if in the terminal).  It should execute fairly
		quickly.</li>
		
		<li>Open the <code>UE4.xcodeproj</code> file.</li>
		
		<li>You can use this project to compule the UE4
		Editor. Select the correct target in the top left of
		the window (it should be UE4Editor - Mac, targeted for
		My Mac).  Then, build the project by going
		to <code>Product -> Build For -> Running</code> in the
		menus. This can take a while (up to 40 minutes), so
		feel free to take a break and grab a coffee or
		something.</li>
		
		<li>After the project finishes compiling, you can run
		the editor by going to <code>Product -> Run</code> in
		the menu.</li>
		
	</ol>

<h2>Adding Mono for Unreal Engine</h2>

	<p>After you've successfuly built Unreal Engine 4.4 from the source, you can add the <em>Mono for Unreal Engine</em> plugins. Here's how to do that:</p>

	<ol>
	
		<li>Download the <em>Mono for Unreal Engine</em> zip
		file from
		our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/download.html">Download</a>
		page (if you haven't already). The file should be
		called <code>XamarinUE4.zip</code>.</li>
		
		<li>Extract the zip file into the UnrealEngine source
		directory, again making sure that the folders are
		merged, not overwritten, in the same way as
		before.</li>
		
		<li>You can then run the terminal commands in the
		UnrealEngine directory (if using a desktop app, you
		can launch a terminal/console window from the app with
		the UnrealEngine repo selected): 
		<pre><code>git checkout 4.4
git checkout -b 4.4-xamarin
git am Engine/Plugins/XamarinUE4/Patches/*</code></pre>
		
		This should create a new git branch called
		"4.4-xamarin" with the <em>Mono for Unreal
		Engine</em> patches applied and committed.</li>
		
		<li>You can now rebuild the Unreal Editor the same way
		as you did before; the <em>Mono for Unreal Engine</em>
		plugins and binding assemblies will be included
		automatically.</li>
	</ol>

<h2>Installing the Xamarin Studio Addin</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Install Xamarin Studio (it can be downloaded from
		the <a href="https://xamarin.com">Xamarin
		website</a>.</li>
		
		<li>Switch your Xamarin Studio update channel to
		Alpha, then download all updates. Mono for Unreal
		Engine requires Xamarin Studio 5.6+ (or MonoDevelop
		5.6+), which are both currently in Alpha. After
		switching your update channel, allow Xamarin Studio to
		download and install all updates.</li>
		
		<li>Open Xamarin Studio, and open the Add-in Manager.</li>
		
		<li>Click the "Install from file" button, browse to
		the directory <code>UnrealEngine/Engine/Plugins/XamarinUE4</code>, 
		select the file <code>XamarinStudio.Unreal_1.0.mpack</code>, and
		install it.</li>
		
	</ol>

<h2>Start Creating!</h2>

	<p>Now that you have <em>Mono for Unreal Engine</em> and all
	the dependencies installed, you can see how to get started by creating
	a new project or adding C# to an existing project on
	our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/getting-started.html">Getting
	Started</a> page.</p>
