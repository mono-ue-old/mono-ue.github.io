<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p class="lead">Starting a new project based on C# and Blueprints.</p>

<h2>Creating the C# Solution</h2>

	<p>Getting started with Mono for Unreal Engine is easy. You
	can start adding C# code to your projects in a few easy
	steps.</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>First, navigate to the File menu and click "Add
		new Mono class to
		project..."<p><img src="images/add_new_class.png"
		height=400px /></p></li>
	
		<li>A dialog will appear asking which parent class you
		want to extend from. For this tutorial, let's choose
		the <code>Actor</code>
		class.<p><img src="images/add_actor.png"  height=400px
		/></p></li>
	
		<li>Click "Next" in the dialog. The next page will ask
		you to name your new <code>Actor</code>. Let's name
		ours <code>TestActor</code>, and click "Create
		Class".<p><img src="images/create_class_wizard.png"
		height=400px /></p></li>
		 
		<li>After creating the class, Unreal Engine will ask
		if you'd like to edit the code now. Click yes, and
		Xamarin Studio will load, showing your newly created
		project.  These classes are accessible from the Unreal
		Editor.<p><img src="images/empty_unreal_project.png"
		height=400px /></p></li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Congratulations! You've made your first C# class in Unreal. Now let's do something with it!</p>

<h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>Our <code>Actor</code>'s behavior will involve controlling
a mesh and rotating it on the screen based on parameters that
we can set from the Editor.</p>

<p>To start off with, you should have a blank solution with one project inside of it, called <code>MyProjectMono</code>. If you're not quite sure what a solution is
and what makes it different than a project, don't fret--we'll learn about that later.</p>

<p>Inside your <code>MyProjectMono</code> project, you should have three folders and a file called <code>TestActor.cs</code>. This is the file we're interested in right now.
Open it up; it should look like this:</p>

{% highlight c# %}
using System;
using unrealEngine.Runtime;
using UnrealEngine.Engine;

namespace MyProjectMono
{
	public class TestActor : Actor
	{
		// Constructor called when creating or loading an object
		protected TestActor(PostConstructInitializeProperties pcip)
			: base(pcip)
		{
		}

		//Constructor for hot-reloading. UProperties will already be initialized, but any purely managed fields or data
		//will need to be set up
		protected TestActor(IntPtr nativeObject)
			: base(nativeObject)
		{
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>Properties</h4>

	<p>Let's add some properties to this.

	<p>We want the properties to be surfaced to the Unreal Editor
	both to be settable by the game designer, as well to allow the
	object properties to be serialized automatically by Unreal
	Engine.

	<p>To do this, in addition to declaring the C# properties, we
	simple add the <code>[UProperty]</code> attribute to each
	property.   There are a number of configuration options to
	use, but in this case, we merely want to specify where in the
	UI the properties should be displayed.

	<p>Put the following code inside <code>TestActor</code>, above the constructors.</p>

{% highlight c# %}
[UProperty(Category = "Static Mesh")]
public Subobject<StaticMeshComponent> MeshComponent { get; set; }

[UProperty(Category = "Movement")]
public float RotationRate { get; set; }

[UProperty(Category = "Movement")]
public bool RotateClockwise { get; set; }

[UProperty(Category = "Movement")]
public float Velocity { get; set; }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now that our <code>TestActor</code> is defined, designers
can create instances of <code>TestActor</code> by selecting it
from the list of available objects in Unreal Engine Editor and
setting the parameters, as illustrated by the screnshot below:</p>

<img src="images/properties.png">

<p><em>Note that any properties that have been decorated
with <code>[UProperty]</code> are automatically serialized for
us, making them editable through the editor.</em></p>

<h4>Initialization</h4>

	<p>When our <code>TestActor</code> object is constructed,
	Unreal invokes a special constructor that takes
	a <code>PostConstructInitializeProperties</code> parameter.
	We can use this to create any subobjects that we need to
	initialize. In our example, we're going to create a <em>static
	mesh</em> to give our <code>TestActor</code> a 3D model.</p>
	
	<p>We can initialize our mesh object by putting the following code into the first constructor:</p>

{% highlight c# %}
protected TestActor(PostConstructInitializeProperties PCIP) : base(PCIP)
{
	MeshComponent = PCIP.CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;StaticMeshComponent&gt;(this, new Name("StaticMeshComponent0"));
	SetRootComponent(MeshComponent);

	RotateClockwise = true;
	RotationRate = 20.0f;
}
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>This sets some default values for our <code>TestActor</code>.</p>

<h4>Behavior</h4>

	<p>Now it's time to give our <code>Actor</code> some
	behavior. Let's override the
	<code>ReceiveTick</code> method. <code>ReceiveTick</code> is Unreal Engine's update method, 
	invoked on every frame. Add the following method to our <code>TestActor</code> class:</p>

{% highlight c# %}
protected override void ReceiveTick(float DeltaSeconds)
{
	float yawDelta = RotationRate * DeltaSeconds;
	if (!RotateClockwise)
		yawDelta *= -1;

	Rotator rotation = ActorRotation;
	rotation.Yaw += yawDelta;

	var forwardVec = ActorForwardVector;
	var location = ActorLocation;
	location += DeltaSeconds * Velocity * forwardVec;

	SetActorLocationAndRotation(ref location, rotation, true);
}
{% endhighlight %}

	<p>This changes our <code>TestActor</code>'s rotation by an
	amount determined by the <code>RotationRate</code>
	and <code>RotateClockwise</code> properties, normalized
	by <code>DeltaSeconds</code>.</p>

<h2>Solutions and Projects</h2>

	<p>Mono for Unreal Engine uses the Xamarin Studio convention of
	Solutions and Projects to
	organize code, and the setup is similar to Visual Studio's C++
	Solutions that you're used to in Unreal Engine. A Solution
	contains one or more Projects, and is typically used to
	organize libraries and individual platform launchers.</p>
	
	<p>We can add C# functionality to an Unreal Engine project by
	creating a new <span class="uiitem">Xamarin for Unreal
	Engine</span> Solution or Project type. The organization of
	our Solution depends on the platforms we want our game to
	support.</p>

<h4>Organizing the Solution</h4>

	<p>We can target a single platform with a Solution that
	contains a single Project for C# code.  When compiled,
	this code loads directly into Unreal Editor or into your game.</p>
	
	<p>Supporting multiple platforms - including mobile platforms
	- requires a different architecture. In a multi-platform
	solution, all game code goes into a Library Project. This can
	be either a native Library Project for a single platform or a
	Portable Class Library (PCL) that contains code shared by
	multiple platforms.  A PCL can use all the APIs available in
	the <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/pcl/introduction_to_portable_class_libraries/">Portable
	Class Libraries API</a> as well as the Xamarin.Unreal.dll
	API. This shared code is used inside the Editor as well as
	inside the game window (or the simulated mobile game window)
	in Unreal Engine.</p>
	
	<p>The code to target each individual platform is housed in
	new Projects of type
	<span class="uiitem">Unreal Engine</span>. For example, an iOS
	game would be housed in a Project type
	of <span class"uiitem">Android > Unreal Engine
	Project</span>). The Unreal Engine Project type contains a
	platform-specific host that boots the application, gives
	control to the native binding, and calls into Unreal Engine to
	start the game at a given point in time.</p>
	
	<p>The screnshot below is an example of what a multi-platform Solution might look like in Xamarin Studio:</p>
