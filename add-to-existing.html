<h1>Adding Mono to an Existing Unreal Project</h1>
<p class="lead">Integrating C# and F# to an existing Unreal project</p>

<p>If you've been developing with Unreal Engine 4, chances
are you already have a body of C++ code and Blueprints.
You can light up your game by adding C# or F# to your
application.</p>

<p>Adding C# code to your project is easy.  In the Unreal
Editor, navigate to the <span class="uiitem">File</span>
menu and select <span class="uiitem">Add Xamarin Code</span>.
This creates a new empty project with a skeleton class that
is accessible from Unreal Editor.</p>

<p>Once the IDE loads, hit <span class="uiitem">Build</span>
and look for the <code>TestActor</code> class to appear in
your class catalog.</p>

<h2>Editing the C# Code for an Actor</h2>

<p>When you select a C# <code>Actor</code> in the Unreal Editor, the Editor
shows the class name. Clicking this link automatically opens the IDE and take you to that class
definition.</p>
