<h1>Async Programming</h1>

	<p class="lead">Complex code made simple.</em></p>

	<p>Async programming is a compiler feature of the C# language
	that rewrites what appears to be linear code into a state machine.
	This makes it much easier to write and understand complex
	gameplay logic.
	
	<p>In async programming, state is tracked using the natural
	idioms of the language. We design the workflow based on
	the natural primitives of the language - we insert
	the <code>await</code> prefix in places where we want to stop
	execution, and our application resumes execution on the tick 
	where it left off.
	
	<p>ToKey see this in action, we override the <code>Update</code>
	 method in <code>Actor</code>, as illustrated by the following code:
	
{% highlight c# %}
protected override async Task Update (CancellationToken token)
{
	
}
{% endhighlight %}


	<p>A behavior that uses async styles might look like this:</p>

{% highlight c# %}
protected override async Task Update (CancellationToken token)
{
    while (Health > 0){
	// chase and shoot
	while (Target.Visible && Ammo > 0){
	    await MoveTo (ComputeApproach (Target));
            await AnimateAsync ("shoot");
            await ShootAt (Target);
            await AnimateAsync ("reload");
	}

	// out of ammo, try to reload
        if (Ammo == 0){
	    // Shows Task.WaitAny to await for multiple operations:
	    // either finds a recharge station, or try to use a 
            // teleport to quickly escape
            await Task.WaitAny (FindRechargeStation (), FindTeleportStation ())
        }
        await MoveTo (ComputePatrolPoint ());
    }
    //
    // We get out of the loop, now run a new loop to show
    // blinking before we vanish
    //
    var original = TintColor;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        TintColor = Yellow;
        await Task.Delay (200);
        TintColor = original;
        await Task.Delay (200);
    }

    // Play the final animation, and then die
    await AnimateAsync ("destroy");
    Destroy ();
}
{% endhighlight %}
   
	<p>This code snippet controls an actor's weapon shooting and
	animations. You can see how the <code>await</code> keyword is
	useful here: in the first <code>while</code> loop, you can see
	a sort of state machine described--first, the Actor attempts
	to <code>MoveTo()</code> its target. When that is done, a
	shooting animation is started
	with <code>AnimateAsync()</code>, followed by a shooting
	behavior through
	<code>ShootAt()</code>. Once the shooting is done, a reload
	animation is started. These states are looped until the target
	is no longer visible or the actor runs out of ammo. All of
	these states are traversed across a large number of frames,
	instead of each method being called every tick.</p>
	
<h4>Low-Level Details: TickSynchronizationContext</h4>

	<p>During the execution of the
	<code>Update</code> method, the thread's synchronization
	context is replaced with a game-specific synchronization
	context that will resume execution on the next Tick.</p>
	
	<p>Any operation that is queued inside the <code>Update</code> method will
	not be dispatched by default into the default synchronization
	context (which would typically have been just an idle handler
	on the main loops).</p>
	
	<p>Instead, the operations are only resumed and executed
	when Unreal invokes the <code>ReceiveTick</code> event. This
	ensures that our code runs in the context that Unreal expects
	it to run.</p>
	
	<p>If we need to queue tasks from the <code>Update</code>
	method to be executed in a different synchronization context,
	we need to manually request that.</p>
