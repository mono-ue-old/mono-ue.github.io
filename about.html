        <p class="lead">Mono for Unreal Engine</p>

	<p>Mono for Unreal Engine is a set of frameworks, libraries
	and tools that enable developers to use C# or F# to write
	their game code on EpicGame's Unreal Engine.

	<p>To redistribute code written with <em>Mono for Unreal
	Engine</em>, you must have a commercial license to the Mono
	runtime.   These licenses are available from Xamarin for Mac,
	Android and iOS online, and you can request Windows licenses
	through support.

	<p>In addition, you still need to comply to your license
	agreement with EpicGames and Unreal Engine.
	
	<p>While it was developed by Xamarin, currently, this is not a
	supported product offering.   We would love to see this grow,
	but for now, you should assume that this an engineering
	project and while we can answer your Mono questions, we can
	not provide guidance on how to build, structure or design
	games with Unreal Engine.
